# project
This project is a frontend and backend microservice for managing perfume and brand data.
## Project Overview
This project is the *frontend of a microservice* designed for users to input and manage data related to perfumes and their brands. It features a user-friendly and visually appealing interface created using *HTML and CSS*. The application provides input fields for users to add the name of a perfume and its corresponding brand. While this is a static design, it serves as the base for further integration with backend services and microservices architecture.

## Features
- *User Input Fields*:
  - Input field for entering the perfume name.
  - Input field for entering the brand name.
- *Stylish Design*:
  - A girly-themed interface with light pink and hot pink colors for a soft and vibrant aesthetic.
- *Interactive Elements*:
  - Buttons with hover effects.
  - Responsive layout for various screen sizes.
- *Scalable Design*: Ready to integrate with JavaScript functionality and backend APIs for dynamic interactions.

## Technologies Used
- *HTML*: For the basic structure of the webpage.
- *CSS*: For styling the interface, making it visually attractive.

## Usage
1. Open the index.html file in any modern web browser.
2. Use the input fields to enter the perfume name and brand name.
3. The "Add" button is currently static but can be connected to backend services for storing the data.

## Integration with Microservices Architecture
This frontend is part of a larger microservices architecture. It interacts with two other services:
1. *Data Storage Microservice*: Responsible for storing perfume and brand details.
2. *Display Microservice*: Retrieves and displays the stored data to users.

## Future Enhancements
- *JavaScript Integration*: Add functionality for interactivity, such as capturing and sending input data to the backend.
- *API Integration*: Connect to backend microservices for storing and retrieving data.
- *Validation Features*: Implement client-side validation for user inputs.
- *Dynamic Design*: Make the interface responsive and adaptive to user interactions.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open index.html in a browser to view the frontend.
